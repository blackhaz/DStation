Version		Release Date		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.5			30 March 2013

* Adopted new alpha/beta version naming.

v0.4			21 January 2012
* Rebuilt for Mac OS X Lion, Qt 4.8.0 and ImageMagick 6.7.4-8 (with OpenCL support, although little is OpenCL-accelerated.)
* Added image statistics. 
* Added scroll bar for all settings to fit small monitors.
* DStation adopts Plastique GUI style for all platforms.
* DStation adopts FreeBSD license.
* Some minor modifications to smoothing user interface (removed median, added sigma control, etc) 
* Added frequency domain equalizer. 
* Supersampling can now be done in fractional steps. 
* Fixed major issue with primitive supersampling algorithm. Added supersampling resize algorithm filtering options.  
* Added CLS (Constrained Least Squares) deconvolution.
* Added Iterative Inverse Filter deconvolution. 
* Implemented anti-artifact FFT buffering. 
* Added low-level brightness/contrast sliders.
* Added low pass noise filter strength adjustment. 
* Added focal length multiplier input. 
* Introduced presets.
* Optimized maths for Usatov filter. 
* Added warning if RAM is insufficient to deconvolve in 32-bit Windows build. 
* Some performance optimizations in the code.
* Fixed UI state if exception was caught while deconvolution. 
* Solved file extension problems when saving images.
* Fixed virtual canvas issues.
* Added mouse-over tooltips. 
* Decreased zoom in/out step from 20% to 10%. 
* Fixed bug with preview frame appearing on blank input image when clicked.  
* Fixed preview menu initial state on Mac OS X version.
* Fixed compression ratio to allow 0.01 to 1 range of values. 

v0.3			16 September 2010
* Resolved exception handling on Windows build by linking statically. Windows build now uses Qt 4.6.2 compiled from source. 
* Resolved Fourier transform multiple images cache workaround with patched 6.6.4-3 Beta ImageMagick libraries. 
* Major code clean-up, optimization and some memory leaks prevention.
* Implemented Wiener filtering in non-HDRI mode that seems to resolve sporadic corrupted image issues - OpenMP-related?
* Added exception handling to deconvolution process. Now DStation outputs error details if deconvolution has failed. 
* Added batch folder deconvolution with external filter.
* Added Wiener deconvolution option with external filter. 
* Added menu item to save filter image.
* Added histogram display.
* Implemented Usatov filter creation stage at low level pixel math.
* Implemented Dynamic Range Extension at low level pixel math that works much faster. 
* Added precision control for saved images. Default is 16-bit now. 
* Implemented Noise To Signal Ratio (NSR) measurement using preview area. Added 32x32 and 64x64 preview area options.
* Fixed benchmark to display correct results when supersampling is used.
* Fixed benchmark not to include post-processing stage.
* Scene falls back to input image if preview is deployed over non-desupersampled deconvolved image.  
* Fixed minor bugs on post-processing stage image display.
* All file dialogs now initialize at last opened directory.
* Moved system-related settings to System tab.
* Disabled toolbar that is not in use at the current moment.
* Added about dialog.

v0.2			5 September 2010					
* Replaced ImageMagick fx operator with low level pixel math that significantly accelerates deconvolution.
* Added separate RGB wavelengths processing mode (Advanced settings) - results in best images.
* In central wavelength mode, Green is used as central wavelength now, as most CCD sensors have QE peaking about there.
* Fixed non-square input image issues. 
* Fixed out of range RGB values (clamping problem) in image displaying function. 
* Added preview
* Added Weighted Usatov with gamma parameter (Advanced settings) for components weights.
* Introduced post-processing stage to apply additional image manipulations without necessity to re-deconvolve original image.  
* Dynamic Range Extension now applies on the post-processing stage, so input information is not lost during this procedure.
* Dynamic Range Extension is disabled when Normalize is turned on.
* Normalization now applies on the post-processing stage.
* Added median as smoothing filter option. (Advanced settings)
* Added smoothing filter variance option. (Advanced settings)
* GUI input elements are now disabled for settings not used by selected deconvolution algorithm. 
* Unnecessary functions are not called when building filters.
* Added automatic noise filter (via ImageMagick enhance operator) to post-processing. 
* Added button to view normalized real component of Fourier transform of the input image.
* Fixed minor bug with screen image placement. 
* Window title now shows input image file name.
* File save dialog now allows to set file format in a user friendly form. 
* Console window color changes and deconvolution button is disabled when deconvolution is in progress.
* Added option to disable post-processing in real time. (Disabled in Windows build by default as it works slow for some reason.)
* Moved supersampling factor and anti-artifact buffer input to Advanced settings. 
* Added an option to disable de-supersampling of deconvolved images.
										
v0.1 (alpha)	26 August 2010	
* First alpha version.
